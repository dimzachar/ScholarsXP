- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography
- **Theme Support**: Light/dark mode with system preference detection
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind breakpoints

### Architecture Overview
The dashboard is implemented as a single-page application with tabbed navigation:
- **Main Dashboard**: `/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` (646 lines)
- **Navigation**: Sticky header with role-based menu items
- **Layout**: Conditional layout wrapper with authentication checks
- **Components**: Modular shadcn/ui components with consistent styling

## Detailed UX Analysis

### 1. Information Architecture & Navigation
